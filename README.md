Hey, this is my github with all the exercises of my Piscine on the 42 Berlim. 
You are probrably not going to find all the answers that you want, but you can stil use this as a helping-hand.
If you don't know what the Berlin42 is, it is a programming school based on peer learning with a really intense applying and joining phase. The school doesn't have any teaches or classes, so you are forced to team-up with the other students to solve the exercises. All exercises train algorithm and programming-logic, besides obligating the student to build (basically) their own libraries in C. So you have to solve all the complex problems by yourself. ALl exercises done are evaluated by a machine AND other students, so you have to be able to explain all your code, ideas and how you combined everything to get the waited result and have to follow other rules by the machine (like writing a clean code, with comentaries, besides creating Git-Repositories, cloning, adding and pushing them);
